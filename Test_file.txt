For the Term Project we completed a. b. c. d. f. (report included) and the bonus functionality.

-Always Start with the INITIAL SETUP below to start the processes before executing a test
- For a. Running two concurrent ATM process see LINE: 51
- For b. Running 3 more concurrent ATM process see LINE: 58
- For c. Running the Interest calculator in included in the INITIAL STARTUP
- For d. Running the System with a deadlock see LINE: 67
- For the Bonus functionality we included the report and the Operation is in ATM OPERATIONS -> FOR A TRANSFER, LINE: 36

INITIAL SETUP FOR RUNNING THE SYSTEM:
Step 1) Open 4 separate Linux Terminals
Step 2) In the first terminal put ./dbserver to run the DB server (main.c)
Step 3) In the second terminal put ./dbeditor to run the DB editor (DB_editor.c)
Step 4) In the third terminal put ./atm 1 to run the the ATM (ATM.c) *1 represents the ATM id, make this any +ve int
Step 5) In the fourth terminal put ./ic to run the Interest Calculator (Interest_Calculator)
Step 6) In the window where you started the ATM there will be a prompt to input your account number:
Input 00001 for the account number *press enter key
Step 7) Next it will ask for your pin: Input 101 for the pin *press enter key
Step 8) After that the ATM will ask what operation you want to proceed with. see below for how to proceed with various
operations
step 9) See below for DB Editor operation

ATM OPERATIONS:
FOR A BALANCE CHECK:
Step 1) If your account number and pin have already been entered go to next step, if not refer to steps 6-7
Step 2) After the terminal asks what operation for you to perform: Input a 1 for a balance check | *press enter key
Step 3) Your balance will be printed shortly after to the terminal

FOR A WITHDRAWAL:
Step 1) If your account number and pin have already been entered go to next step, if not refer to steps 6-7 in
INITIAL SETUP
Step 2) After the terminal will ask what operation for you to perform: Input a 2 for a withdrawal | *press enter key
Step 3) Next the terminal will ask for the amount to withdraw: ENTER AMOUNT (eg. 100) | *press enter key
Step 4) Your balance after the withdrawal will be print to the terminal shortly after

FOR A TRANSFER:
Step 1) If your account number and pin have already been entered go to next step, if not refer to steps 6-7 in
INITIAL SETUP
Step 2) After the terminal will ask what operation for you to perform: Input a 3 for a Transfer | *press enter key
Step 3) Next the terminal will ask for the account to send to: ENTER ACCOUNT NUMBER (eg. 00117) | *press enter key
Step 4) Next the terminal will ask for the amount of money to send: ENTER AMOUNT TO SEND (eg. 100) | *press enter key
Step 5) Your balance after the money transfer will output in the terminal shortly after

DB Editor Operations:
TO ADD ACCOUNT:
Step 1) The terminal will prompt for an account number: ENTER ACCOUNT NUMBER (eg. 54321) | *press enter key
Step 2) The Terminal will then ask for your desired PIN: ENTER PIN (eg. 678) | *press enter key
Step 3) The terminal will then ask for your funds: ENTER FUNDS (eg. 1000) | *press enter key
step 4) reopen/refresh db.txt and the file will be updated with the new account

FOR RUNNING 2 CONCURRENT ATM PROCESSES:
(This section is used to run two concurrent ATM processes with the system for a. in the term project)
Step 1) Open another Terminal and call ./atm 2 (you will now have 2 ATM processes running, ids 1 and 2)
Step 2) Input 00011 when prompted for the Account number | *press enter key
Step 3) Input 317 when prompted for the PIN | *press enter key
Step 4) Refer to ATM OPERATIONS above for further ATM operations

FOR RUNNING 5 CONCURRENT ATM PROCESSES
(This section is used to run 5 concurrent ATM processes with the system for b. in the term project)
Step 1) Open 3 more terminals and call ./atm 3/4/5 (one number per executable) in each of them
Step 2) Look inside db.txt to and use and input different account number for each new ATM process (eg. 12345)
| *press enter key
Step 3) Use the corresponding pin +1 for each of the PINs in the new ATM processes (eg. 311 + 1 -> INPUT 312)
| *press enter key
Step 4) Refer to ATM OPERATIONS above for further ATM operations for each process

FOR CREATING A DEADLOCK:
(this section is used in the case you want to see the deadlock we generated for d. in the term project execute)
Step 1) Open 3 Terminals
Step 2) In the first terminal put ./dbserverdeadlock to run the DB server with the deadlock (maindeadlock.c)
Step 3) In the second terminal put ./atm 1 to run the first ATM process (ATM.c)
Step 4) In the third terminal put ./atm 2 to run the second ATM process (ATM.c)
FOR THE FIRST ATM PROCESS:
Step 5) Input Account number: 00001
Step 6) Input PIN: 101
Step 7) STOP AND DO FOLLOW STEPS FOR ATM PROCESS 2 BEFORE INPUTTING AN OPERATION
FOR THE SECOND ATM PROCESS:
Step 8) Input Account number: 00117
Step 9) Input PIN: 152
Step 10) DONT INPUT AN OPERATION YET
FOR INPUTTING OPERATIONS:
Step 11) For the first ATM process input 3 for the operation
Step 12) For the Second ATM process input 3 for the operation
Step 13) For the first ATM process input 00117 for the Account to transfer to
Step 14) For the second ATM process input 00001 for the account to transfer to
Step 15) For both ATM process input 100 for amount to send (do this step within 10 seconds of each other to generate
the Deadlock)
